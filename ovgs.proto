// The OVGS service defines a heirarchy of 'groups', which are identified by a
// group_id (allocated by the server). Each group can have several  child groups;
// Pinned Domain Certs are associated to a group, serial numbers can be assigned to a
// group (which serves to limit the set of Users who can issue vouchers for those
// serial numbers to Users who have the necessary permissions in that group)
// Groups are created by users (except the root group, more on this later) and roles
// are assigned to users (limiting the set of operations a user can invoke) per group.
// Any permissions accorded by these roles on a group are heirarchical in nature.

// Note that the creation of a User is external to the ovgs service. Users may be
// created by any mechanism that the service implementor may offer. It is assumed
// that all such Users are known to ovgs, which only deals with the assignment of
// roles to them.
// Root group - Each customer/org is assigned a name. The org_id can be constructed
// as "org-" + org name.  A root group with org_id as the group_id is pre-created
// and all serial numbers owned by the org are added to this root group. Moreover,
// an initial User is given ADMIN role over this root group as part of the setup,
// which can then be used to bootstrap the rest of the org tree - add more users,
// create child groups, assign serials to them, add certs and finally, issue
// vouchers for a serial number.
